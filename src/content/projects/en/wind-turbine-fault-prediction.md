# Wind Turbine Fault Prediction with SVM, PCA and LDA

## Project Overview

Unplanned wind turbine downtime can reach 237 hours per year, directly affecting revenue and increasing maintenance costs. This project developed a non-invasive method for early fault detection using only generator current signatures, achieving 97.6% accuracy.

## Technical Approach

### Data Generation
- **Synthetic Database**: Used TurbSim for wind simulation, FAST for GE 1.5s turbine modeling, and MATLAB/Simulink for PMSG generator simulation
- **Non-invasive Monitoring**: Only generator electrical signals were used, eliminating need for additional sensors

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- **PCA Implementation**: Achieved 99.99% variance retention while reducing dimensionality
- **LDA Integration**: Further reduced to 6 components for optimal classification
- **Data Reduction**: 98% reduction in dataset size while maintaining information content

### Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel
- **Optimization**: Grid-Search with 10-fold cross-validation
- **Benchmarking**: Compared against k-NN, QDA, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, ANN, and linear SVM

## Results and Impact

### Performance Metrics
- **Global Accuracy**: 97.6%
- **F1 Score**: ≥ 0.92 across all fault classes
- **Processing Speed**: Hyperparameter search reduced to ~2 minutes
- **Comparative Performance**: Superior to all benchmark algorithms

### Business Value
- **CAPEX Reduction**: No additional sensors required
- **OPEX Optimization**: Early detection reduces maintenance costs
- **Revenue Protection**: Minimizes unplanned downtime
- **Scalability**: Method applicable to different turbine models

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Example of the preprocessing pipeline
def preprocess_data(signals):
    # Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
    pca = PCA(n_components=0.9999)
    pca_features = pca.fit_transform(signals)
    
    # Apply LDA for class separation
    lda = LDA(n_components=6)
    final_features = lda.fit_transform(pca_features, labels)
    
    return final_features
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Implementation**: Deploy model for continuous monitoring
2. **Multi-turbine Networks**: Extend to wind farm-level predictions
3. **Additional Fault Types**: Include gearbox and blade fault detection
4. **Edge Computing**: Implement on-site processing for reduced latency

## Research Impact

This work demonstrates that electrical signature analysis can effectively replace traditional vibration-based monitoring systems, providing a cost-effective solution for the wind energy industry while maintaining high accuracy standards.
