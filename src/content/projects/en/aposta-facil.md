# Aposta F치cil: Social Betting Platform

## Project Overview

**Aposta F치cil** is an innovative web platform developed to organize **recreational and healthy betting** among friends and communities. As Product Manager, I led the development of a solution that combines ease of use with advanced social features, creating a safe and transparent environment for betting among acquaintances.

## Product Strategy

### Problem Identified
During sporting and social events, groups of friends frequently organize informal bets, but face challenges such as:
- Lack of organized record of bet terms
- Difficulty tracking participants and results
- Absence of transparency in final results
- Complex manual management for organizers

### Value Proposition
- **Centralized organization**: complete record of bets, rules, and participants
- **Total transparency**: clear visualization of all aspects of the bet
- **Access flexibility**: public or private bets with different permission levels
- **Simplicity**: intuitive interface that allows creating bets in less than 1 minute

## Product Architecture

### Initial Interface (Main Page)

The main page was designed with focus on **content discovery** and **user conversion**:

**Features without authentication:**
- Exploration of existing public bets
- Viewing titles, descriptions, and result options
- Participation in public voting (when allowed by creator)
- Preview of values and closing dates

**Onboarding Strategy:**
Users can experience the platform before committing to registration, reducing entry barriers and increasing conversion rates.

### Authentication System

![Post-authentication interface](/images/projects/aposta-facil/apostafacil3.png)

**Google OAuth Authentication:**
- **Implementation**: Secure integration with Google Auth
- **UX**: One-click login, no complex forms
- **Security**: Third-party identity validation
- **Unlocked features**: Bet creation, own content management

### Bet Creation Flow

- **Closing date/time**: Automatic deadline for voting
- **Result options**: Customizable alternatives for voting

**Advanced configurations:**
