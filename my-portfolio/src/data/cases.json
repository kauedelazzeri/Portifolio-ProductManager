      "context": "Unplanned wind turbine downtime can reach 237 h/year, directly affecting revenue and increasing maintenance costs. The proposed method uses only generator current signatures — a non-invasive approach that reduces CAPEX and OPEX — and achieves 97.6% accuracy in early fault detection.",
