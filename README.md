# KauÃª Delazzeri - Product Manager Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase who I am as a **Product Manager**, my **experience** across electric mobility, platform architecture, and digital payments, and the way I approach **data-driven product decisions**.

Here youâ€™ll find a selection of my work, side projects, and the tools and skills I apply in real-world scenarios â€” all with a clean and minimal design.
